# Project-2D
Project 2D final draft. Includes the .html file, the .Rmd file, and any necessary files.
The .RMD file contains the original code for my final draft of project 2, along with the .html file that includes the output of the code. Both of these files contain the description of the project. The scientific question is "Are there neuron activity-dependent down-regulated genes in the brain, and, if so, what may the pathways these genes are involved in reveal about the role of gene down-regulation in brain development?", and the hypothesis is "If there are neuron activity-dependent up-regulated genes in the brain that have some known role in fine tuning processes involved in brain development, then there may also be genes that are down-regulated (whose transcription is reduced in response to some stimulus that depolarizes the neuron cell membrane), and whose protein products may be both important for brain development, and perhaps bear some similarity to known transcriptional repressors that would help shed light on the molecular mechanism of down-regulation". The other 2 files included are the .csv file with the raw counts data from the RNA seq, and the fasta file with the DNA sequence of the protein of interest.
